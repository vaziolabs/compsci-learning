*   **Core CS Concepts (Design Patterns):** `Entity-Component-System (ECS)` (common in game engines), `State`, `Strategy` (collision response types), `Observer` (collision events).
*   **Visualization:** Real-time 2D or 3D simulation of objects interacting according to physics rules.

**Project 14.2: Simple Ray Tracer**

*   **Description:** Implement a basic ray tracing algorithm to render scenes with simple geometric primitives (spheres, planes), basic lighting (ambient, diffuse, specular), shadows, and reflections.
*   **Why Interesting:** A classic computer graphics project combining geometry, linear algebra, and recursion to generate realistic images.
*   **Core Math Concepts:** Vector geometry (rays, intersections), linear algebra (transformations), basic optics (reflection/refraction laws).
*   **Core CS Concepts (DSA):** `Recursion` (for reflections/refractions), `Vector/Ray Classes`, `Scene Graph` or object list, `Acceleration Structures` (optional, e.g., BVH).
*   **Core CS Concepts (Design Patterns):** `Strategy` (different materials/shaders), `Composite` (scene graph), `Builder` (constructing the scene).
*   **Visualization:** Rendered 2D image output of the 3D scene. Intermediate visualizations of ray paths optional.

**Project 14.3: Data Visualization Dashboard Builder**

*   **Description:** Create a tool that allows users to upload datasets (e.g., CSV) and build interactive dashboards with various chart types (bar, line, scatter, pie) to explore the data. Integrate statistical analysis features.
*   **Why Interesting:** Combines DSA (data handling), statistics (analysis), design patterns (UI components, chart generation), and potentially web technologies to create a practical data analysis tool.
*   **Core Math Concepts:** Basic statistics (mean, median, variance, correlation), data aggregation.
*   **Core CS Concepts (DSA):** `Data Parsing` (CSV), `Data Structures` for tabular data (e.g., list of dictionaries, DataFrame-like structures), `Chart Generation Libraries`.
*   **Core CS Concepts (Design Patterns):** `MVC`/`MVVM` (for UI), `Factory` (creating chart objects), `Strategy` (different chart types/analysis methods), `Builder` (configuring charts).
*   **Visualization:** Interactive web-based or desktop dashboard displaying various charts based on user-uploaded data.
